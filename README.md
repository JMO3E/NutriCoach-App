# NutriCoach

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NutriCoach is a mobile application that is designed to help athletes manage their daily nutrition based on their training intensity, ensuring they meet their nutritional needs for optimal performance. Developed a dynamic and responsive frontend using Flutter, and Express.js to ensure performance and flexibility. MySQL is used for efficient data storage. To ensure the quality and reliability of the code, I use Postman, Sinon, Supertest, Chai, and Mocha for testing.
